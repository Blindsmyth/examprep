# In gdb, use these commands to debug:

# Set a breakpoint at the realloc line
break 97

# Run with a test pattern
run "test"

# When you hit the breakpoint, check values:
# print res
# print buffer
# print total_read
# print bytes

# Step one line (execute the realloc)
next

# Now check what buffer actually is:
# print buffer
# print (void*)buffer
# x/1xw &buffer  # Show the memory address stored in buffer

# Check if it's NULL:
# print buffer == NULL
